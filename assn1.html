                Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;

                
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="mouse1">
        </div>
        
        <div id="para2" onmousemove="mousepos()">    
            <p>
                Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                Though as for that the passing there<br>
                Had worn them really about the same,
            </p>
        </div>
        
       <div id="para3" onmousemove="mousepos()">
           <p>
               
               And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>

           </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="para4" onmousemove="mousepos()">
           <p>
               I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.
